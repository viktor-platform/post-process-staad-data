 Build a VIKTOR app to process and visualize outputs from STAAD.Pro. Export these outputs from STAAD.Pro directly into VIKTOR, and process design ratios for multiple load combinations. Using Pandas and taking advantage of the flexible components that VIKTOR offers.

Here is what this app covers:

-Creating an input table to receive STAAD.Pro data
-Processing the exported data within VIKTOR
-Displaying processed outputs for user selection
-Generating a table view that shows the distribution of design ratios
